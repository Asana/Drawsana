     - shapeUpdater: An object which you may inform of out-of-band shape updates.
     Normally, `DrawsanaView` only checks for changes during tool operations,
     but some tools (e.g. `TextTool`) make changes based on arbitrary user
     input and need a way to update the selection rect and such.
     - context:
     - shape: Tools may be activate with "initial shapes." One use case for this
     is the selection tool handling a double-tap on a text shape. The UI can
     choose to activate the text tool and immediately enter the edit state.
